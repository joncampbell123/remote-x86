Code consolidation:
   For 8086, 286, and 386-16 code:
     Consolidate con_char_in and con_char_out, they all work the
     same and make no segment references, they only assume that DS
     is set properly. [DONE]
   
Protocol:
   - Type up a document describing the communication protocol [TODO]

   - Add command to protocol that allows the host to ask: what's the lowest
     memory address available for me to work with? (to avoid overwriting the
     debugger) [DONE]

Stage 1 loader:
   - Make an El Torito CD-ROM boot sector, so that you can burn this code
     to CD-ROM and use it on newer machines where a floppy drive is lacking [DONE]

   - Find out why your bootable CD-ROM fails under Microsoft Virtual PC (oh but of course!)

Host-side software:
   - Write Linux user-space program to talk to the client

   - Turn code into a useful library that you can link into any program you
     wish to write

   - Write code to upload various simple tests to test the sanity of the
     debugger, in each mode

   - Write simple CPU tests for the various CPUs to make sure it works

Actual hardware:
   - This code works great with Bochs and VirtualBox. Now... see how well it
     works on:
       - Your Intel Quad Core test machine (quadcore51)
       - Your AMD64 Dual Core (tvtest51)
       - Your old Pentium laptop (portable51)
       - Andy's old Pentium laptop
       - The ancient 386 laptop
       - That 286 laptop you just got off Ebay
       - The ancient 8088 XT sitting in your bedroom
         ^ make sure you test 8086, 286, 386-16, 386-32, and x64 modes on each
